        <p>
          My full name is "Mardonbek Khamidov Farkhadovich," or simply{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">@mkf</span>. As a child, I was really
          interested in hardware engineering. I disassembled tons of devices to
          see how they worked under the hood. This curiosity was one of the main
          reasons I chose software engineering as my careerâ€”because the two
          fields are quite similar. When I attended my first programming
          courses, I realized it was the one path in life I could truly enjoy
          and get paid for. I got my first laptop when I was about 8 years old,
          and I loved using it. I became fascinated by desktop and web apps. I
          really wanted to create something like YouTube, which helped me learn
          to build things by hand. Even today, one of my biggest goals is to
          create a social media platform.

          <span className="text-white/70">#</span> Frontend Education
        </h3>
        <p>
          I first started programming courses in{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">2022</span>, but for some reasons, I
          dropped out after two months. Then, on{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">February 23, 2023</span>, I began
          learning frontend development at Web King Education Center. After
          studying diligently for one year, I completed the course on{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">February 23, 2024</span>. During that
          time, I became familiar with JavaScript, React.js, and many helpful
          npm libraries. I kept asking myself, "Can I build something that
          really matters?" The answer was interesting: "Yeah, if I had someone
          to build the backend!" But that wasn't my preferred way of workingâ€”I
          wanted to do it myself. Thatâ€™s when I realized I needed to learn
          backend development.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          <span className="text-white/70">#</span> Backend Education
        </h3>
        <p>
          I began backend development with{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Ruby</span>, and it was my{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">first love</span>. I loved how it
          boosted my productivity. Ruby did its job beautifully with{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Ruby on Rails</span>. It was easy to
          use and had a beautiful, elegant syntax I really enjoyed. But as I was
          mainly a frontend developer at the time, RoR wasn't easy for me. After
          struggling with it, I switched to{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Node.js</span>. It was more
          complicated than Rails, but pushing through that complexity helped me
          level up as a backend developer. I also considered learning PHP and
          Golang, but none of them felt like Ruby. Eventually, I returned to
          Ruby on Railsâ€”and this time, everything clicked. I understood its
          methods and really enjoyed working with it. Unfortunately, there are
          few Ruby jobs in Uzbekistan, so now I use Ruby on Rails mainly for
          side projects.
